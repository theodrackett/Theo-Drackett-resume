        <ul>
            <li><p>I am dedicated to continuous improvement, a concept ingrained in me during
                my time at a manufacturing company during my college years, where we embraced the Japanese 
                principle of KAIZEN.</p></li>
            <li><p>
                As a tech enthusiast, I am keen to collaborate on innovative hobbies involving 
                Python, JavaScript or Java, my programming languages of choice.
